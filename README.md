# Bad apple in unity by streepje8
Feel free to change the code to fix the problems i made ^_^
Even though i made this for fun and i don't have much attachment for it. Please don't copy it or upload a video of it without crediting me.

How to use:
Open the project in unity
On the top click badapple > start
then wait for it to spawn all the 1200 windows!
When its done you can press frameboi in the same menu to start playback
When done you can press stop to make all the windows close.
You can just close the frameboi like you normal would.
If for whatever reason the stop button doesnt work (because it crashed for example) you can reset your unity view to default to fix it.
